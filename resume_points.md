# Resume: Formula 1 Historical Search Engine

Here are professional title options and bullet points you can use for your resume, tailored to highlight different strengths (Backend, Full Stack, or Systems).

## 🏷️ Project Titles
* **Formula 1 Historical Search Engine & Analysis Platform** (Strong General)
* **High-Performance Java Information Retrieval System** (Backend/Algo focus)
* **Full-Stack F1 Historical Data Application** (Web/Integration focus)

## 📋 Bullet Points (Pick 3-4)

*   **System Architecture & Design**: Designed and built a modular **Java-based search engine** from scratch, featuring a layered architecture (Service, DAO, Controller) to index and query decades of historical Formula 1 data.
*   **Algorithms & Logic**: Engineered a custom **ranking algorithm** that intelligently scores search results based on keyword relevance, partial matching, and historical significance (weighted wins/podiums).
*   **Database & Optimization**: Implemented a **normalized SQLite database** with raw **JDBC**, optimizing complex SQL queries for efficient data retrieval and aggregation of driver/constructor statistics.
*   **Full-Stack Implementation**: Developed a lightweight, dependency-free **HTTP Web Server** in Java to expose a RESTful API, integrated with a modern **HTML5/CSS3** dark-mode frontend for real-time interaction.
*   **Data Structures**: Utilized efficient data structures and OOD principles to handle data seeding, validation, and in-memory processing of thousands of race records.
*   **Tools & Deployment**: Managed version control with **Git** and enabled dual-mode execution (CLI & Web) to demonstrate versatility in application deployment.
